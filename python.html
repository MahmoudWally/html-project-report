            <li>Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and simple to implement. It is open source,
                which means it is free to use, even for commercial applications. </li>
            <li>Python is considered a scripting language, like Ruby or Perl and is often used for creating Web applications and dynamic Web content.
                It is also supported by a number of 2D and 3D imaging programs, enabling users to create custom plug-ins and extensions with Python.
                Examples of applications that support a Python API include GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, and Autodesk Maya.</li>
            <li>Scripts written in Python (.PY files) can be parsed and run immediately.
                They can also be saved as a compiled programs (.PYC files),
                which are often used as programming modules that can be referenced by other Python programs.</li>
            <li> Python can run on Mac, Windows, and Unix systems and has also been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines</li>
