        <ul>
            <li>Java is a general purpose programming language, much like Python or JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The language itself is specifically an object oriented programming language, so bears similarities to C++, C#.</li>
            <li>Java is also a platform, which means that Java code can run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on it.Originally those two things were interchangeable, and the only thing that ran on the JVM was Java. But since that time,
                a number of languages have been written which can run on the Java platform, languages like Scala, Groovy, an implementation of Ruby called jRuby,and an implementation of Python called Jython</li>
            <li>The creators of Java were strongly influenced by existing programming languages like C and C++, with which Java shares a lot of syntactic similarities.
                They used these languages as an example of how not to do things, so there were certain features that the creators of Java explicitly decided not to include,
                because they had been troublesome for programmers using C and C++.</li>
            <li>Java has been around for such a long time, so it’s really well established. There are a lot of great books, online resources.</li>
            <li>There are probably more Java programmers than any other type of programmer in the world, so a lot of people already know Java and it’s easy to find people who can help you out and mentor you</li>
            <li>Java derives its syntax from C, and lots of other languages also derive their syntax from C, so if you learn Java, then learning a language like Javascript, C#, or C++ is much easier.</li>
            <li>It’s an object-oriented language, so a lot of the foundational concepts you learn inside of Java are transferable to other languages.</li>     
        </ul>
